                Hi, I am [Your Name], a Machine Learning enthusiast and MERN stack developer with a Saiyan-level passion for using technology to build practical, effective solutions. I just graduated in 2025 from SRKR Engineering College as a [Your Major – e.g., Computer Science & Engineering] graduate.

I am skilled in developing responsive, dynamic web applications with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js and remain actively engaged with the fast-growing, ever-changing world of machine learning. Whether working on developing scalable full-stack projects or working on predictive models, I love where data meets development.

Drives by curiosity and constant energy, I'm continuously on the lookout for chances to learn, co-operate, and contribute towards great projects that transcend the horizon of innovation — exactly like an actual Saiyan becomes stronger with every obstacle.
